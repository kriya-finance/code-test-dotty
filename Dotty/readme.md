The goal of this exercise is to read an input that will be in dot matrix format and output
to the console the integer representation of that number.

Example: input.txt should output to the console "3".

You may:
 - Change the existing code as you see fit
 - Install any libraries you choose to (currently NUnit is referenced but use whatever you
 feel comfortable with)
 - Use Google (we do daily!)

 We're looking at your approach to the problem, so talk us through your thinking.
